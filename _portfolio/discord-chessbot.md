ChessBot is a Discord bot that allows users in a server to challenge each other and play full games. You can play moves in either SAN or UCI notation, request move takebacks, offer draws, and resign, all within Discord's interface. You can find the source code of the project at [its github repo](https://github.com/firefly293/chessbot).
